In designing this problem, my original idea was to create a hard link. Using that hard link 
I would then delete the file provided but still have a hard link to it therefore saving the file. 
I began to think a little harder though and decided that this solution was unworkable for one simple reason. 
This simply doesnt work across partitions. additionally, hard links simply don't work for directories. 

Therefore I put two systems under consideration: A symbolic link and hiding trash system or an mv based trashed system. 
I decided on the mv based trash system because it makes reopening access to a file considerably easier and restoring its original location is considerably easier. 

How this system works: 


srm

A file "file.txt" for example is chosen for srm
full_file_path=readlink -f file.txt
mv "$full_file_path" "$TRASH/$full_file_path" 

**voila** the file is magically gone

the same follows for directories but with realpath instead of realink

unsrm

a file "file.txt" is chosen for srm
full_file_path=$(pwd "file.txt")
confirm file exists in trash
if file exists
mv TRASH + $full_file_path $full_file_path

lsrm

ls -l $TRASH

du
